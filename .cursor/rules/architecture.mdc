# GymRoutine Mobile Architecture

This application follows a layered architecture pattern with SwiftUI for UI and Firebase for backend services.

## Architecture Layers

1. **UI Layer**: SwiftUI Views in Features directory
   - Follows MVVM pattern with ViewModels
   - Root navigation with [Router.swift](mdc:gymroutine-mobile/Application/Router.swift)

2. **Business Logic Layer**: Manager classes
   - Handles application logic
   - User authentication and session management

3. **Data Access Layer**: Repositories and Services
   - Services: Handle API/Firebase communication
   - Repositories: Provide data access abstraction

4. **Model Layer**: Data models
   - Entity models for app data

## Firebase Integration

- Authentication via Firebase Auth
- Data storage in Firestore
- Cloud Functions for server-side logic
- Analytics for user behavior tracking
