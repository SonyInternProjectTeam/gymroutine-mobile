# GymRoutine Mobile Coding Conventions

## Swift Style Guidelines

1. **Naming**
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions
   - Use PascalCase for types and protocols
   - Use descriptive names that convey purpose

2. **File Organization**
   - Group related functionality in the same directory
   - One primary class/struct per file
   - Extensions in separate files when logical

3. **SwiftUI Patterns**
   - Use MVVM architecture for views
   - Keep views small and focused
   - Extract reusable components to ViewParts directory

4. **Error Handling**
   - Use Swift's Result type for handling errors
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Handle errors at appropriate levels

5. **Documentation**
   - Document public APIs with comments
   - Include parameter descriptions for non-obvious functions
   - Add TODO comments for incomplete functionality

6. **Analytics**
   - Log important user actions
   - Include relevant context in analytics events
   - Use consistent event naming conventions
