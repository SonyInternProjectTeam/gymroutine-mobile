# GymRoutine Mobile Development Workflow

## Feature Development

1. **Planning**
   - Define feature requirements
   - Create necessary models in Models directory
   - Outline UI components needed

2. **Implementation**
   - Create/update Models as needed
   - Implement Repository layer for data access
   - Create Services for API interactions
   - Implement ViewModels for business logic
   - Build SwiftUI Views in the Features directory

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests in gymroutine-mobileTests directory
   - Create UI tests in gymroutine-mobileUITests directory
   - Perform manual testing on device/simulator

4. **Firebase Backend**
   - Update Cloud Functions in backend/functions as needed
   - Test functions locally before deployment
   - Update security rules as necessary

## App Flow

The app starts with [gymroutine_mobileApp.swift](mdc:gymroutine-mobile/Application/gymroutine_mobileApp.swift) which initializes Firebase and sets up the main window. Navigation is handled by [Router.swift](mdc:gymroutine-mobile/Application/Router.swift) which manages the app's navigation state.
